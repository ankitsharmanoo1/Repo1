    <p>For fundamental positive change to happen in the world, the world of everybody (all-at-once) must represent itself (all-at-once).

        The world of everybody (all-at-once) must get out of the position of passively accepting guidance and receiving calls to virtue. The world of everybody (all-at-once) must accept the necessary position of taking control of the world-situation. That is what must happen—or else there can no longer be any hope of a cooperative world at peace.
        
        2.
        
        Political and cultural leaders are not, themselves, going to be able to make this change occur. Such a profound degree of change cannot be brought about by the virtuous voice alone. Rather, such a profound degree of change can only be brought about by the force of humankind as a collective whole, or the “everybody force”. The inherent collective of everybody-all-at-once actually is (always) the only true power—but that collective is not currently exercising that power, because that collective is dis-united and in chaos.
