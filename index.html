    <h1>Save the <b> TREES</h1>
         <h2>by<i> The <sub>Ankit Sharma</sub></i></h2> <hr>
         <p>The <b><i>Save Tree</i> Artical will provide a better 
            insight into why trees need to be saved. 
            Possibly the above hazards of the absence of vegetation do not discourage us enough,
             or we basically don't give a pin. We can be sure of the fact that nature, 
             especially trees are in grave danger and we must take steps to prevent their existence on Earth.
              In this essay on “saving trees”, we will discuss in detail
              the procedures that can be taken to reduce deforestation and preserve trees. </p><hr>
    <h3><strong>The Greatest Danger to Trees</strong></h3>     
    <p>Each time we push a plan for another urban city or initiate a lodging venture, 
        we are gradually killing tree life. This is because developments of structures of any sort 
        consistently include the utilisation of wood from trees. 
        Likewise, to extend the city or construct new ones, we need to chop down trees to make space
         for houses to get comfortable. These two variables are the most significant threats faced by 
         our environment.
