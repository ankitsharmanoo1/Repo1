                    <h4 align="center">1. South Africa</h4><br>
                    <p><b>South Africa</b>   is still holding firm in our top 10, up +9%, and the value of the rand is still one of the biggest pulls to the country, ensuring incredible food and drink at affordable prices. Kuoni experts say a glass of wine will set you back around £1.80 on average. Escorted touring is up +18% and the popularity is driven by the country’s diverse mix of cities, beaches, winelands, battlefields and the opportunity to go on safari. Kuoni’s 11-night Classic South Africa escorted small group safari is the most popular, which includes wine-tasting in Franschhoek’s vineyards.</p>

                    <p><b>Antigua</b>  enters our top 5 for 2020. Virgin Atlantic is adding flights into Antigua from June 2020, increasing its service from three to four times a week. More flight availability means Antigua is looking great value for money. This year, Kuoni has added two new hotels for customers. The first is Hammock Cove Antigua, a collection of brand new ultra-modern villas, each with a plunge pool and personalised cocktail counter on your veranda. Kuoni has also added the Royalton Antigua Resort & Spa, featuring the island’s first-ever overwater bungalows.</p>

                    <p><b>Italy</b>  has jumped up one place in our top 10 and we still expect to see the usual lift in late bookings as we head into the spring and summer months. Puglia holidays are up, for both touring and single-centre holidays, with Kuoni’s Highlights of Puglia tour the most popular for 2020. Despite Brexit uncertainty, escorted touring in Italy is up +14%. While demand for the traditional favourites of Sicily, Sardinia and Tuscany remain strong, it’s Puglia that’s seen the most noticeable rise.</p>

                    <p><b>Bali</b>is up one place in our top 10 and Kuoni customers still favour an Ubud and beach combination to experience two sides of the island. Bali is great to visit during our summer months and peak wedding season, so it’s a top choice for honeymooners. Kuoni’s experts have also seen an interest in Singapore and Bali twin-centres.

                        Kuoni has added new destinations such as Lovina in the north of Bali, offering a less-commercialised experience of black sand beaches, local fishing communities and wild dolphin watching. Kuoni has also added new hotels in Lombok and the Gili Islands, which include the brand new pool villas at The Kayana Lombok; and The Royal</p>

In 1972, Kuoni was the first UK tour operator to offer Maldives holidays and the region has seen steady growth, welcoming over 1.5 million visitors in 2019. The government is hoping to increase worldwide visitor numbers to over seven million by 2027, helped by heavy investment in airport links, including the one billion USD development of Velana Internatio and new additions include Reethi Faru, with memorable dining locations including cabanas.</p>
