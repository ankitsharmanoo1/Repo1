 <!-- <p><u>This is a paragraph</u></p> -->
<p align="justify"><b>Tigers generally gain independence at around two years of age and attain sexual maturity at age</b> three or four for females and four or five years for males. Juvenile mortality is high, however—about half of all cubs do not survive more than two years. Tigers have been known to reach up to 20 years of age in the wild.
<u>Males of the larger subspecies, the continental tiger, may weigh up to 660 pounds.</u> For males of the smaller subspecies—the Sunda tiger—the upper range is at around 310 pounds. Within both subspecies, males are heavier than females.
<s>Tigers are mostly solitary, apart from associations between mother and offspring.</s> Individual tigers have a large territory, and the size is determined mostly by the availability of prey. Individuals mark their domain with urine, feces, rakes, scrapes, and vocalizing.
Across their range, tigers face unrelenting pressures from poaching, retaliatory killings, and habitat loss. They are forced to compete for space with dense and often growing human populations.</p> <br><hr>
<h2 align="center">Why Should we <sup>Save</sup><sub>Tiger</sub></h2>
<p align="justify"><i>Tigers are the largest members of the cat family and are instantly recognizable thanks to their striking orange and black stripes. These apex predators are capable of taking down prey of all sizes, from rodents to elephant calves. 

    Increasingly in recent decades, human activities such as poaching have pushed tigers to the brink. Their range in Asia is a tiny fragment of what it once was, and all remaining tiger populations are threatened with extinction</i> </p>
